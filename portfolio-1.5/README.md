**But the page will be found on it's own domain in short time.**

# Process and result

This is the first version of what will be my final portfolio page. I am planning on rebuilding this page with React later.

This page is not quite finished yet. There is a list of things I want to add before I feel satisfied with the result. I want to see if I can find a better way to work around relative items, and also add more information about each of the projects. There is also some missing styling, and the mobile/tablet version is also not optimized.

I also plan on adding more detail to navigation menu, hover-effect, smooth auto-scroll, and maybe some animations. I also want to implement a better display of the projects.

_The page supports dark mode and is set to match the system settings._
